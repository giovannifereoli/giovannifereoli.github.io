Hi friends, I'm John. 

I am a fifth year PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems theory. 

Currently, I have an affinity for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and how they can be used to solve problems facing the gravity field modeling community.
