Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a compelling way to blend the powerful modeling capabilities taken from the machine learning community with the analytic rigor of the mathematicians and physicists who came before.

By augmenting traditional machine learning cost functions with differential equations, PINNs offer way to ensure that the model learned will be compliant with the physics of the true system. 

This proves to be a powerful modification, one that reinvigorates the argument that machine learning can learn considerably more productive basis functions for the gravity modeling problem.  

This paper provides the first exploration of PINNs applied to the gravity modeling problem.
