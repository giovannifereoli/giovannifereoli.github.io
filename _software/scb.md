**Scarabaeus** is a modular and high-performance open-source tool for orbit determination and navigation, designed for interplanetary spacecraft and small-body proximity operations. It is developed by the Orbital Research Cluster for Celestial Applications (ORCCA) Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder.

The software features a Python front end with C++ and Rust backends for key numerical components. It supports:

- precise force modeling (polyhedral gravity, SRP, third-body, J2, etc.),
- radiometric measurement modeling (Doppler, sequential ranging),
- estimation algorithms (Batch least squares, SRIF),
- and tooling for trajectory design, residual analysis, and uncertainty quantification.

Scarabaeus is currently being used in support of the [Emirates Mission to the Asteroid Belt](https://www.mbrsc.ae/emirates-mission-to-the-asteroid-belt), and is expected to be fully open-sourced in 2025. Documentation is already available below.
